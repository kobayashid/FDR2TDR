# FDR2TDR.py

## Overview
`FDR2TDR.py` is a Python script that processes a Touchstone file (`.s1p`) to analyze the time-domain step response for TDR (Time Domain Reflectometry) applications. The program reads the input file, performs the necessary signal processing, and outputs the results as a CSV file. It also visualizes the step response in a plot.

## Usage
```bash
python FDR2TDR.py input.s1p output.csv
